Mark C Bell
===========

I am a Visiting Fellow at the University of Warwick as part of their `2017/18 EPSRC Symposium on Geometry, Topology and Dynamics in Low Dimensions <https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/2017-18/symposium/>`_.
Previously I was a `J. L. Doob Research Assistant Professor <http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Programs/doob-postdocs.html>`_ at the University of Illinois.
Before that I was a PhD student under the supervision of `Dr. Saul Schleimer <http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masgar/>`_ at the University of Warwick.

In the past I have done work with the `National Center for Supercomputing Applications <http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/>`_ and the `Illinois Geometry Lab <http://www.math.illinois.edu/igl>`_.

Conferences
-----------

Recently I have been part of:

In 2012 it was based on `Word Processing in Groups <http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/seminars/areas/gtreading/2012-13/>`_ and in 2013 it was based on the `Bestvina-Handel algorithm <http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/seminars/areas/gtreading/2013-14/>`_.

Writing
-------
Some of the things I've written about can be found on the `arXiv <http://arxiv.org/a/bell_m_3>`_.
This includes:

 - Computing trisections of 4-manifolds
 - Cubical Geometry in the Polygonalisation Complex
 - Polynomial-time algorithms for curve graphs
 - Asymmetric dynamics of outer automorphisms
 - Applications of fast triangulation simplification
 - Simplifying triangulations
 - Slow north-south dynamics on PML
 - The pseudo-Anosov and conjugacy problems are in NP and co-NP
 - Deciding reducibility of mapping classes is in NP
 - The monodromies of homogeneous links

Software
--------

I have also written several pieces of :ref:`software` including:

 - :ref:`twister_software` computes triangulations of surface bundles over the circle and Heegaard splittings.
 - :ref:`flipper_software` decides the Nielsen--Thurston type of a given mapping class and, for pseudo-Anosov mapping classes, constructs a layered, veering triangulation of their mapping torus, as described by Agol.
 - :ref:`curver_software` for performing calculations in the curve complex.

Teaching
--------

 - Spring 2017 Math 241 - Calculus III
 - Spring 2016 Math 403 - Euclidean Geometry
 - Fall 2015 Math 403 - Euclidean Geometry
